# 📱 Fishbowl Mobile App

The **Fishbowl Mobile App** was my first major project beyond basic apps. Built for my A-Level Computing course, it serves as a platform where students can connect in real-time and create chat rooms on specific topics. Other students can join these rooms to ask questions or share knowledge, aiding both the asker and those offering help.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🌟 Features Implemented

1. Live Chats

4. Custom Chat Room Creation

## 🚀 How It Works

Users can create channels with unique IDs that represent new chat rooms, and others can join, subscribing to the room’s channel. Messages sent in the room are shared only with members, creating focused discussions. Users are unsubscribed from a room when they leave, while real-time status updates show who’s online. Following and upvoting are also managed through sockets, enhancing the social experience.
